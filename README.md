# Operating-System
Operating System that I made with the help of TA's for a summer project

Because this is saved into a .tar file, you'd need to clone this and open it using: 'tar -xvf xv6.pdxP3.tar'. 

Most of the 'meat' of this project is in the proc.c folder. To view, simply 'cd' into the dist directory and open proc.c using 'vim proc.c' (or any editor of your choice).

Flags in the Makefile are already set, so to run the project, simply use 'make run' to run program from the program directory.
